# Developer Assessment Project - Executive Summary

## Key Findings & Status

### Assessment Implementation Status
- **Current Phase**: Test rounds for enlisted developer assessments have commenced
- **Highest Score Achieved**: 39 points
- **Assessment Difficulty**: Increased complexity compared to previous iterations

### Critical Issues Identified & Resolved

#### 1. GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Issue
- **Problem**: Code removed from pipeline script preventing developers from pushing changes
- **Impact**: Blocked candidate workflow during initial testing
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

#### 2. Test Environment Contamination
- **Problem**: Developer accidentally included implemented function in candidate repository
- **Impact**: All candidates received unearned credit for Python code portion
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

#### 3. GitLab Access Issues
- **Problem**: Candidates unable to access various GitLab pages
- **Impact**: Hindered candidate ability to complete assessments
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved during second iteration

### Assessment Validity Concerns
- **Score Reliability**: Results may be skewed due to initial setup and access issues
- **Environmental Constraints**: Test environment limitations potentially affecting candidate performance
- **Recommendation**: Consider score normalization or re-assessment for affected candidates

### Next Steps Required
- Monitor subsequent test iterations for consistent performance metrics
- Evaluate impact of environmental constraints on assessment validity
- Consider adjustments to scoring methodology to account for identified issues
