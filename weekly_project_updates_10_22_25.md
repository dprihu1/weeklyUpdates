# Developer Assessment Project - Executive Summary

The developer assessment project is currently in the testing phase with enlisted candidates, achieving a highest score of 39 points on a more challenging assessment than previous iterations. Three critical issues were identified and resolved during initial testing: a GitLab CI/CD pipeline configuration that blocked candidate code submissions, test environment contamination where an implemented function was accidentally included in the candidate repository (giving all candidates unearned Python credit), and GitLab access problems that prevented candidates from reaching assessment pages. While these issues have been fixed, they raise concerns about assessment validity and score reliability, requiring consideration of score normalization or re-assessment for affected candidates. Moving forward, the team will monitor subsequent test iterations for consistent performance metrics, evaluate environmental constraints' impact on assessment validity, and consider scoring methodology adjustments to account for the identified technical issues.


# ProxySummit 2.0

ProxySummit 2.0 is an AI-powered suite that automates critical intelligence workflows and enhances operational decision-making. The suite includes ReportGPT, an LLM that converts analyst operational notes into standardized SITREPs, and ChiefGPT, an intelligent interface that processes intel reports, network data, and equipment documentation to provide recommendations, troubleshooting, and system overviews. This project delivers immediate value by reducing report generation from hours to minutes, ensuring consistent communication formats, providing instant troubleshooting expertise, and enabling rapid synthesis of operational data into actionable intelligence. The result is improved operational tempo, reduced human error, better knowledge transfer between personnel, and greater capacity for analysts to focus on high‑value interpretation rather than administrative tasks.
