Lessons Learned Template
Event: NVIDIA GTC Conference
Date(s): 25 OCT 27-29
Attendee: Matthew Yuan

1. Key Takeaways
(Summarize new knowledge, skills, or insights gained during the event.)
Gained general insight to understand recent and future advances in AI, as well as corporate insights on applications utilizing AI. For example, I learned from the NVIDIA keynote that networking is a vital requirement for supporting GPU clusters; the Crowdstrike presentation introducing Agentic vulnerability detection stressed human-in-the-loop usage of agents for vulnerability patching, as well that agents are currently not useful for initial intrusion detection; Palantir introduced a unified data analytics platform (utilizing Frontier LLM API tokens) simplifying a data->project->execution plan workflow which we can emulate on a smaller scale with an open-source model. Also introduced to many NVIDIA libraries/models such as nemotron, CuOPT, CuVS etc. which could be useful for future GPU-enabled projects we have.

2. Key Benefits
What were the most valuable takeaways or benefits from attending?
(Highlight how the event contributed to personal or organizational growth.)
Networking, seeing how other corporations are solving large-scale problems that we might encounter in simpler variants (Palantir-DS, Crowdstrike-Cybersecurity, AWS-infrax), understanding future advances in AI realm (robotics, next-gen Rubin GPU architecture and capabilities, etc.)

3. Recommendations & Actions
Should this event be attended annually? Why or why not?
Leadership (Crew Lead/Project lead) can attend for awareness; other developers can attend based on their interest in specific workshops training 


4. Overall Value
On a scale of 1–5, how valuable was this training for our team?
3; Great for gaining “large-picture” perspective on AI/DS, but overall less focused training and heavily focused on NVIDIA products. Great trainings and workshops on various topics such as GNN/KAN, but either overly specific on a corporate application or intro/general level which we already got exposure during the NPS training in September

5. Additional Feedback
Any other observations or thoughts on the event?
(This is a space for logistical feedback, speaker quality, or other details.)
Overall very high quality event, well organized and generally important; can promote to other developers local/interested in industry collaboration (etc. UNAD)

Lessons Learned
Event: NVIDIA GTC Conference
Date(s): 25 OCT 27-29
Attendee: CPT Emma Houston

1. Key Takeaways
What was the most significant or unexpected thing you learned?
(Summarize new knowledge, skills, or insights gained during the event.)

Some of the more valuable panels I went to were AI for Good: Tackling Climate and Environmental Challenges in U.S. Cities, Accelerating AI for the Public Sector: NVIDIA and AWS Collaboration, and Building Teams of Trustworthy AI Agents in Regulated Environments. In AI for Good, I learned how AI is being used for real-world problems and how it has had real and physical positive consequences. This is a bit of a departure from our recent projects, but I would love to get into this type of proactive work. In the Accelerating AI for the Public Sector, the biggest takeaway was how models can be fine-tuned differently for different purposes. That’s more like our current work, and with our focus on use of pre-trained models, understanding which situations to use which fine-tuning methods is crucial. Finally, in the Trustworthy AI Agents talk, the most interesting thing was the different tiers of regulation that NVIDIA does. It’s not a difficult concept, but it is interesting to see how it’s being done at an enterprise level.

2. Key Benefits
What were the most valuable takeaways or benefits from attending?
(Highlight how the event contributed to personal or organizational growth.)

To me, the most beneficial part of the conference was the panels/talks. Because we aren’t in a position to consider acquisitions or purchasing, I thought that seeing the industry collaborations and processes was helpful to encourage creativity in our own organization.

3. Recommendations & Actions
Should this event be attended annually? Why or why not?
(Provide a recommendation based on the value derived and relevance to goals.)

I liked the conference a lot, though I’m not sure it would be worth it if we had to pay or travel for it. I think if we could have attended the training that were offered, it would have been much more valuable. For it being free though, I think it was a good use of time.

4. Overall Value
On a scale of 1–5, how valuable was this training for our team?
(1 = Low Value, 5 = High Value)

3. I learned a lot about industry processes and different vendors, but it was more beneficial for personal development rather than organization development.

5. Additional Feedback
Any other observations or thoughts on the event?
(This is a space for logistical feedback, speaker quality, or other details.)

The conference was incredibly well done. It ran every smooth, and the app was very clear. I really didn’t have to pre-plan much of my day because it was so flexible. It was great to have lunch, coffee, and snacks provided.
