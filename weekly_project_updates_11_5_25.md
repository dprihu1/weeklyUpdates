# NVIDIA GTC Conference After Action Report
**Date:** October 25-29, 2025  
**Attendees:** Matthew Yuan, CPT Emma Houston

## Key Technical Insights
Both attendees gained valuable exposure to AI advances and enterprise applications. Key learnings included networking requirements for GPU clusters, human-in-the-loop AI agent implementations (Crowdstrike), unified data analytics platforms (Palantir), model fine-tuning methodologies for different purposes, and enterprise-level AI regulation frameworks. Exposure to NVIDIA libraries (nemotron, CuOPT, CuVS) provided potential tools for future GPU-enabled projects.

## Strategic Value & Benefits
The conference provided essential "big picture" perspective on AI/data science industry trends and corporate problem-solving approaches relevant to our scaled operations. Attendees observed how major corporations (Palantir, Crowdstrike, AWS) tackle challenges similar to ours, offering insights for organizational creativity and collaboration. Understanding of public sector AI applications and trustworthy AI implementation in regulated environments directly applies to our operational context.

## Recommendations & Future Actions
**Attendance Strategy:** Leadership should attend annually for strategic awareness; developers can attend selectively based on specific workshop interests and training needs. **Cost Consideration:** High value when free/local, but cost-benefit analysis required for travel/paid attendance. **Training Focus:** Future attendance should prioritize hands-on workshops over general presentations for maximum organizational benefit.

## Assessment & Logistics
**Team Value Rating:** 3/5 - Strong for strategic perspective and personal development, moderate for immediate organizational application. **Event Quality:** Excellent organization, user-friendly mobile app, comprehensive logistics including meals and refreshments. Well-structured format allowing flexible daily planning.

## Overall Summary
The NVIDIA GTC Conference provided valuable strategic insights into AI industry trends and enterprise implementations relevant to our mission. While not immediately actionable for current projects, the exposure to cutting-edge technologies, regulatory frameworks, and industry best practices offers long-term organizational benefit. The conference is recommended for leadership awareness and selective developer participation, with optimal value when attendance costs are minimal. Both attendees agreed the event was well-executed and worthwhile for understanding the broader AI ecosystem and potential future capabilities.
