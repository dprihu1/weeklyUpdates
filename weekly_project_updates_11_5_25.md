# NVIDIA GTC Conference After Action Report
**Date:** October 25-29, 2025  
**Attendees:** Data Science Section (we attended)

## Key Technical Insights
We gained valuable exposure to AI advances and enterprise applications. Our key learnings included networking requirements for GPU clusters, human-in-the-loop AI agent implementations (Crowdstrike), unified data analytics platforms (Palantir), model fine-tuning methodologies for different purposes, and enterprise-level AI regulation frameworks. Exposure to NVIDIA libraries (nemotron, CuOPT, CuVS) highlighted potential tools for our future GPU-enabled projects.

## Strategic Value & Benefits
The conference gave us an essential "big picture" perspective on AI/data science industry trends and corporate problem-solving approaches relevant to our scaled operations. We observed how major corporations (Palantir, Crowdstrike, AWS) tackle challenges similar to ours, which offered ideas for organizational creativity and collaboration. Our understanding of public sector AI applications and trustworthy AI implementation in regulated environments directly applies to our operational context.

## Recommendations & Future Actions
**Attendance Strategy:** We recommend leadership attend annually for strategic awareness; developers should attend selectively based on specific workshop interests and training needs.  
**Cost Consideration:** High value when free or local, but travel/paid attendance should be justified with a cost-benefit analysis.  
**Training Focus:** Future attendance should prioritize hands-on workshops over general presentations for maximum organizational benefit.

## Assessment & Logistics
**Team Value Rating:** 4/5 — We find it strong for strategic perspective and professional development, moderate for immediate organizational application.  
**Event Quality:** Excellent organization, user-friendly mobile app, and comprehensive logistics including meals and refreshments. The format allowed flexible daily planning.

## Overall Summary
NVIDIA GTC provided us with valuable strategic insights into AI industry trends and enterprise implementations relevant to our mission. While not immediately actionable for our current projects, the exposure to cutting-edge technologies, regulatory frameworks, and industry best practices offers long-term organizational benefit. We recommend the conference for leadership awareness and selective developer participation, with optimal value when attendance costs are minimal. Our team agreed the event was well-executed and worthwhile for understanding the broader AI ecosystem and potential future capabilities.
